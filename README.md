# simple video downloader(svd)
- svd is a simple downloader for common video urls passed as json.

### It can download:
1. Raw videos e.g example.com/video.mp4
2. Segmented videos (hls)
3. Specific live videos (from facebook and Instagram)
4. Specific Dash xml videos

### Notes
1. simple json should include url,headers & type e.g
    ```json
    {
        "url":"example.com/video.mp4",
        "headers":
                    {"referer":"example.com"},
        "type":"raw"
    }
    ```

2. Since creating this json could be tedious, a simple svd browser extension
    is provided [here](https://github.com/fskamau/svd-extension)
	
3. The program will continously read stdin for control signals.
-  Passing / or c will read clipboard contents and treat them as json.
-  passing . or q will quit immediately.
